# War-Project
In this project, the code will simulate a game of War. War is a card game between two players. A description of this game and its rules can be found here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war

I will simulate a game of war using 3 different coding languages: Elixir, Haskell, & Rust. Through Elixir and Haskell, I will implement a function called deal that accepts and returns a list of integers. Through Rust, I will implement a function called deal that accepts an immutable reference to an array of u8, and returns ownership of a new array of u8. 

For more details on the War Project game, check out the information in my README file
